    <!--Don't use bold tag anymore. Use strong instead-->
    <p><strong>Just putting a bold tag example here. </strong>>Procrastination is caused by inertia - the tendency for
        things stay as they are. It is a permanent feature of life,
        like hunger, and should be accepted and dealt with as such. The way to tackle it is to simply get started in a
        small
        way and slowly develop a rhythm over time.</p>

    <!--Use em instead of i for italization.-->
    <p><em>Guard the momentum you have built up on activities that are important to you.</em> Do your best to avoid
        letting your
        good habits slide. It’s a lot easier to keep them going than to start again from scratch.</p>

    <p><em>Be prepared for off days when you feel more sluggish than usual.</em> Don’t think too much about it and start
        wondering
        where all your motivation went. Don't start ruminating over how to overcome perfectionism or fear of failure.
        All
        these are dead ends that don't lead anywhere. Instead, just throw on another pot of coffee, and get on with your
        day. Over time, you will notice that things start to flow harmoniously again.</p>
