<p>HERE IS A PARAGRAPH NOT IN SIDE A DIVISION ELEMENT. WHOOPIE</p>

<div>
  <p class="hello">Behold, a paragraph with a class!</p>
  <p id="special">Behold, here is ap paragraph with an ID!</p>

  <h2>Here is header 2 (H2)</h2>
  
  
  <p>Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.' - Sheev Palpatine</p>

  <h2>And yet again, another h2</h2>

  <p>Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
    don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
    work, your breath certainly will get 
    the job done, 'cause you definitely 
    need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
    you breath <em>stinks</em>! You almost burned 
    the hair outta my nose, just like the 
    time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
    continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
    his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
    berries. I had strong gases leaking 
    out of my butt that day.</p>

  <h2>Here is the last h2 I swear</h2>

  <p>I am the very model of a scientist salarian,

    I've studied species turian, asari, and batarian,
    
    I'm quite good at genetics (as a subset of biology),
    
    Because I am an expert (which I know is a tautology),
    
    My xenoscience studies range from urban to agrarian,
    
    I am the very model of a scientist salarian!</p>

  <p>Feast your eyes: the last paragraph!</p>
