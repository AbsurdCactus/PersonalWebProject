// 5 Primitive Dataypes. Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Null, and undefined.

//Javascript doesn't care if a number is an integer or a float
//Modulus is the same.(remainder)

"she said \"goodbye\""  //this will help you add quotations in javascript (ESCAPE CHARACTERS)

//concatenation exists
"hey guys".length  //strings have a length property

"howdy"[0] //accessing individual characters with an index

var yourName = "jimmy" //this is how you declare a variable

//DYNAMIC TYPING: where a veriable can change from one datatype to another without any problem. 

//undefined just means you have not given a variable any value yet
var name;

//Null means EXPLICITELY NOTHINGNESS
var currentPlayer = null;

//Think of methods as a library of pre-written code

alert("duck dad")//just a method which gives off an alert


//prompt lets a prompt come up in the browser
prompt("what is your name")
