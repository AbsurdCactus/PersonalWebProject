    <h1>CLAY'S PAGE</h1>
    <b>My name is Clay</b> Blah Blah Blah. Gonna post a cool quote to edit.

    <p>Procrastination is caused by inertia - the tendency for things stay as they are. It is a permanent feature of life,
    like hunger, and should be accepted and dealt with as such. The way to tackle it is to simply get started in a small
    way and slowly develop a rhythm over time.</p>

    <p>Guard the momentum you have built up on activities that are important to you. Do your best to avoid letting your
    good habits slide. It’s a lot easier to keep them going than to start again from scratch.</p>

    <p>Be prepared for off days when you feel more sluggish than usual. Don’t think too much about it and start wondering
    where all your motivation went. Don't start ruminating over how to overcome perfectionism or fear of failure. All
    these are dead ends that don't lead anywhere. Instead, just throw on another pot of coffee, and get on with your
    day. Over time, you will notice that things start to flow harmoniously again.</p>
